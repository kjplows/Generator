In this file, common physics parameters for the long-lived HNL simulation are defined.
Ideally, the user would come here to tweak parameters such as HNL mass and mixings as well as switch
on/off certain hooks such as Majorana nature, polarisation effects, etc.
It would also be interesting to set the interesting decays here (relevant in case a specific channel is
not specified in the arguments of the code itself, helps POT)

This is a demo file meant for first-time use. You can use this by putting it in $GENIE/config/CommonHNL.xml and the fluxes and ROOT-geometries generated in $GENIE/src/contrib/beamhnl.
It models a Dirac HNL of 200 MeV/c^2 mass and couplings |Ue4|^2 = |Um4|^2 = 10^-7, |U_t4|^2 = 0
Signal channels are the two-body decays pi + mu, pi + e and the three-body invisible decay v + v + v.

For simplicity, the BEAM and USER frames are unrotated with respect to the NEAR frame.
